        <h4 id="p2-1">Video Summary</h4>
        <iframe width="600" height="338" style="border-radius: 14px; border-color: black; border-width: 4px;"

        <h4 id="p2-2">Brainstorming</h4>
        <img src="docs/assets/brainstorm-2.png"  width="600px" alt="p2 brainstorm" class="inline"/>
        <p>While brainstorming ideas for aspects of wellbeing that our group could tackle, we came up with several categories: Physical, Mental, Social, and Academic. Interviews we conducted indicated that the one that would be most well-received was a mental wellbeing chatbot. From this, we generated more focused ideas in the mental wellbeing area with the 3 main ones being:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li style="font-weight: bold">Emotional Management</li>
          <dd>A non-judgemental listener for students to talk about their concerns and feelings, providing empathy, validation, and reassurance while also suggesting coping strategies or referrals to mental health resources as needed.</dd>
          <li style="font-weight: bold">Stress Management</li>
          <dd>Offers strategies and exercises to help students manage stress and anxiety, such as breathing techniques, or time-management strategies. It could also suggest healthy habits, such as exercise or healthy eating, that can improve mood and reduce stress.</dd>
          <li style="font-weight: bold">Mental Health Education</li>
          <dd>Provides information and education about mental health and wellbeing, including common mental health concerns, warning signs, and coping strategies. By promoting mental health literacy, it could help reduce stigma and improve students' ability to recognise and address their own mental health needs.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 id="p2-3">Storyboard (Jane)</h4>
        <img style="margin-top: -20px" src="docs/assets/storyboard1.png" alt="p2 storyboard1" class="inline"/>
        <p>Jane is a Year 1 student, and is feeling overwhelmed by her upcoming exams. Being introverted means that she hasn't made many friends and thus hasn't had the necessary emotional support required to properly adapt to University life. She wants someone to talk to at night when she's feeling lonely.</p>
        
        <h4>Storyboard (John)</h4>
        <img style="margin-top: -20px" src="docs/assets/storyboard2.png" alt="p2 storyboard2" class="inline"/>
        <p>John is a Year 4 student, and is in the process of job-hunting. Unlike his peers, he has yet to receive any offers and doesn't have the same level of work or research experience. With his future uncertain, John feels very stressed and would appreciate someone to empathise with his situation.</p>
        <h4>Storyboard (Jerome)</h4>
        <img style="margin-top: -20px" src="docs/assets/storyboard3.png" alt="p2 storyboard3" class="inline"/>
        <p>Jerome is a Year 2 student who is actively involved in student society activities, and is studying a dual degree program. Although he has a lot of friends with similar interests, he often gets into arguments and encounters conflict on top of his rigorous academics. Feeling lost with this heavy burden, he wishes to consult his current school life with someone.</p>
        
        <h4 id="p2-4">Design Decisions</h4>
        <p>Based on the storyboards created, we settled on having the main design goals for the chatbot be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cheers users up</li>
          <li>Gives advice</li>
          <li>Listens and supports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also kept usability heuristics and Gestalt theories in mind when designing the interface.</p>
        <dl>
          <p style="font-weight: bold">Usability Heuristics</p>
          <li>Consistency</li>
          <dd>Design a UI similar to WhatsApp so users can feel like they're just talking to another friend</dd>
          <li>Minimalism</li>
          <dd>Design a UI that is easily understood and navigable</dd>
        </dl>
        <dl>
          <p style="font-weight: bold">Gestalt Theories</p>
          <li>Proximity</li>
          <dd>Place consecutive messages from the same party closer together than the opposite side's to emphasise grouping</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4 id="p2-5">Prototyping</h4>
        <p>Cherry and I were responsible for the prototype RASA chatbot. The bulk of our work went into coming up with as many intents as possible so each of the "stories" we had written could most accurately capture a user's intent.</p>
        <h4 id="p2-6">Verification</h4>
        <p>To ensure that our prototype met the target users' needs, Hoon performed speed dating and usability testing with some students using our completed chatbot.</p>
        <img src="docs/assets/speeddating.png"/>
        <p>Suggestions included having a brief introduction before entering the chatroom, a more interesting UI, and the ability to save chat history, . With these in mind, we overhauled our prototype UI. </p>

        <img src="docs/assets/brainstorm.png" width="600px" alt="brainstorm" class="inline"/>
        <p>Through our user empathising process, we compiled a variety of problems that students face every day on campus, and sorted them into 4 distinct categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Canteen (All-in-one ordering app)</li>
          <li>HKUST Apps (PathAdvisor, Student Center-related troubles)</li>
          <li>Transportation (TKO Shuttle bus / commercial bus schedules, seat vacancies, etc.)</li>
          <li>Facilities (Lecture hall / room seat availability, device charging, air-conditing troubles)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="p1-3">The Problem</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Lines are too long especially right after classes have just concluded</li>
          <li>Food items are regularly sold-out, so after waiting in line it's possible that your desired order is no longer available for purchase</li>
          <li>The menu is not informative enough with details like allergies</li>
          <li>Payment methods are limited</li>
          <li>Lacking customisation options for people with dietary restrictions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div style="display:flex;">
          <div style="flex-basis:67%">
            <h4 id="p1-4">Persona</h4>
            <p>We created a persona - Steve - to inform the different design choices for our prototype app. As an international exchange student, Steve can't communicate with the predominantly Chinese-speaking staff in their native tongue, nor is he familiar with the cuisine - the most prevalent one across all of HKUST's dining choices. Specific dietary restrictions are also not properly catered to in most cases, with information for vegans / vegetarians such as himself and people with allergies not being readily available. With little time between classes, he also finds it inconvenient to wait for such long periods of time before being served his food.</p>

        <h4 id="p1-8">Reflection</h4>
        <p>Having finished this project, I found myself more familiar with the ideating and designing process. While I myself didn't have much prior experience with the food ordering side of the HKUST campus, empathising with the students who do made coming up with product Design Goals a much easier task. </p>
        <p>My groupmates were truly great! Diligent, hardworking, and amazing initiative allowed us to get a majority of the project done in the first couple of days. The environment - although slightly intimidating just because of how on-top of everything everyone was - was a pleasure to work in and encouraged contribution. Willingness to seek and improve on feedback was another standout attribute of my groupmates.</p>
